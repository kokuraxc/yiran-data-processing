# file name converter

Converter all 331 folders' names from Chinese to English so they can be easily put up to the web server.

There is tons of folders with Chinese temple names as their names. The purpose of the program is to convert the Chinese names to temple IDs.

The excel file ```112aec6807a515c3.xlsx``` contains temple names and their IDs.

In some cases, the folder doesn't have a corresponding temple ID. Then the ```Folder Name``` column comes to use. It assigns a fixed ID to the ```Folder```.

Nevertheless, there are still 58 folders left without proper IDs. They will require manual work later on.
