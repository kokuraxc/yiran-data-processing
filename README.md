# yiran-data-processing
This is the place I store the scripts that I wrote to help out with Ranran's data processing work.

As her needs differ from time to time, and also arise irregularly, most of the scripts here cater to some specific task.

But in most cases, they involve processing `CSV` and/or `TEI`/`XML` files.

Till now all the scripts are written in `Python`.
